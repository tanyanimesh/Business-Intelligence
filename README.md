# Business-Intelligence
This repository contains the code and documentation for a case study on optimizing the supply chain efficiency of Boeing's Dreamliner 787. The project includes a Python file implementing predictive models, along with analysis to identify and suggest optimizations in the supply chain. Along with a detailed PDF file describing the case study.

The case study addresses the following key areas:
- Supply Chain Challenges: Analysis of the supply chain inefficiencies faced by Boeing, including delays, forecasting issues, and resource allocation problems.
- Predictive Modeling: Use of Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression to enhance demand forecasting and production planning.
- Optimization Solutions: Strategies such as Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory, Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS), and end-to-end supply chain visibility to mitigate inefficiencies.
- Benefits and Challenges: Evaluation of the proposed solutions' advantages and potential obstacles in implementation.
- Recommendations: Suggestions for future improvements in Boeing's supply chain management, including advanced quality management systems, blockchain technology, and lean manufacturing principles.
